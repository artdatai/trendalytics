It's being made into a movie 😱The book is one of the few stories that is likely to stay with me for life...hope the film will be (as) good too.	10154912951423949_10154913366763949	2016-11-30T20:19:36+0000

These horror films might not have scored big at the box office, but they do have one thing in common: a cult following. http://imdb.to/2gg2mKM	15925638948_10154911186598949	2016-11-30T01:00:05+0000

Westworld star Jeffrey Wright has been known in recent years for playing brainy characters. "No Small Parts" takes a look at some of the more diverse roles he's played over the years.	15925638948_10154910973848949	2016-11-30T00:04:00+0000
Don't forget Boardwalk Empire, he was fantastic in that.	10154910973848949_10154911085223949	2016-11-30T00:09:01+0000

Man I saw that f-er as an extra on Grimm and he did this weird thoat clearing noise before every scene that sounded like he was dying. I still have yet to get paid from Grimm btw and I'm pissed	10154910973848949_10154911572908949	2016-11-30T04:28:06+0000
He's so good in Basquiat if you get a chance to see it. It's one of my favorite movies because of his portrayal of the artist.	10154910973848949_10154911703983949	2016-11-30T05:53:28+0000
I loved him in Syriana.

What??? No "Peoples" that's one of the only reasons I've watched "Shaft" sooo many times.	10154910973848949_10154911125203949	2016-11-30T00:24:45+0000

Who could forget his career defining role of Peoples Hernandez in Shaft! He got robbed of an Oscar for that one.	10154910973848949_10154911125938949	2016-11-30T00:25:25+0000

It really sucks that you guys are suing CA over the age discrimination case. Arguing that ages can be found on Wikipedia, etc means nothing when you're the first place people go to research actors. That's not a lot of respect for the people that are your biggest draw. #lame	10154910071458949_10154911021723949	2016-11-29T23:31:34+0000

I enjoyed him as an actor, but what a total idiot as a person. Typical Hollywood hack with a liberal showcase agenda and no sense of logic.  Di Nero promotes online-bullying, rioting and destruction as a justified means for change. That behavior is unacceptable and pathetic.  Waiting for you to move to Canada like you promised.	10154909858313949_10154909918648949	2016-11-29T16:35:41+0000
I lost respect for him and many other Hollywood people during the election. I don't care who you are voting for, just don't push that on me and tell me I need to vote for your person too.	10154909858313949_10154910043553949	2016-11-29T17:34:04+0000

One of the greatest actors of all time and equally disgusting as a human being. I will never pay to watch anything he performs in again. Truly sad.	10154909858313949_10154910753233949	2016-11-29T22:06:45+0000
Ah yes, more hypocritical "an actor doesn't agree with my asinine perspective therefore they should have theirs be stifled or mocked" comments.	10154909858313949_10154910515883949	2016-11-29T20:49:34+0000
I'm done with him and all of the other holly-weird libtards. I hope the jerks that made the movie loose their asses on it because of people like me boycotting him	10154909858313949_10154911180343949	2016-11-30T00:57:02+0000

Is  it only me that think that hollywood is a family business? Like, they are all related one way or another. Imagine the great actors we lost in history because "Hey, i have a brother, i think he could do the part" (Not saying that this actors are all bad, but some of them are "meh")	10154908178328949_10154908367918949	2016-11-29T01:58:22+0000

politicizing movies to pursue the globalist agenda, as the two writers of the movie tweeted is propaganda, nothing more : “Please note that the Empire is a white supremacist (human) organization.” It’s one that’s opposed in Rogue One “by a multicultural group led by brave women,” chimed in Weitz’s co-writer Gary Whitta.	10154907758448949_10154908886633949	2016-11-29T06:52:15+0000

and yet no logical answer on why the dumb tech didn't shut down maeve the very first time instead of doing everything a robot was saying. besides the fact they couldn't have only dolores as lead character or huffington post and buzzfeed would have unleashed a witch hunt.	10154907196338949_10154907430533949	2016-11-28T18:54:20+0000

I expect "Rules Don't Apply" to flop for a  number of reasons. One being it's a film about old Hollywood, and it's not a subject that many care to see. Two, it deals with Howard Hughes, and he's a subject that many don't really care about; plus films about him have been done so many times over so many years. Finally, Warren Beatty knows at his old age, it may be time to pack it in, as audiences prefer younger stars these days.	10154905695888949_10154907660073949	2016-11-28T20:40:08+0000

Who is more powerful: Lord Voldemort or Gellert Grindelwald? The Fantastic Beasts cast shares their answers: http://imdb.to/2fSmlPt	15925638948_10154903113723949	2016-11-27T05:23:03+0000
Most traumatic and horrible experience of this month was when Grindewald showed up and "WHY HIM, WHY?!?! Why that awful, one-sided actor, again?? Colin Farrel was so epic, so cool, so badass, and... they ruined it!"
Decent movie tough.	10154903113723949_10154903342098949	2016-11-27T07:10:09+0000
In the books, Voldemort was considered to be the most powerful dark wizard of all time.  Grindelwald, however, was second only to him, and was just about on par with Albus Dumbledore.	10154903113723949_10154903132178949	2016-11-27T05:36:27+0000
Voldemort was more powerful, more magically gifted, but an idiot. Actually that makes him a very credible villain, because intolerant and aggressive people are almost always not very smart. Grindelwald is more the classic Fantasy-villain: an evil mastermind like Sauron or Palpatine.	10154903113723949_10154903733318949	2016-11-27T11:49:24+0000
My biggest problem with the movie was that the books explicitly state that Grindelwald never became as notorious as Voldemort because he stayed in his own little corner of Europe. He was too afraid to even go to Britain because Dumbledore was there. Fantastic Beasts totally contradicts that.	10154903113723949_10154903251293949	2016-11-27T06:32:43+0000
This movie was such a disappointment, and is nothing at all like the Harry Potter movies...
It's basically just your average superhero flick (except for the character of Newt, because he doesn't have a standard superhero personality.. he's more like a cooler peter parker) with shallow characters and a romantic sideplot to spice things a bit up. The only thing it has in common with the Harry Potter series is the fact that it takes place in the Harry Potter universe	10154903113723949_10154903507893949	2016-11-27T09:22:37+0000
Watched the film yesterday with three more friends and it was awesome! I guess from a perspective-wise, the Harry Potter franchise is more personal and focused. While the Fantastic Beasts (and probably the upcoming films) franchise is more adventurer, exciting, funny, opened-world, can be thrilling and scaring, and giving it's from the same universe as Harry Potter, it's good to know that the universe we're speaking of is open to more dimensions.	10154903113723949_10154904112083949	2016-11-27T15:05:22+0000
Lore wise I believe Grindelwald is actually a more powerful wizard over voldemort. But even Dumbledore beat Grindelwald and he had the elder wand and Dumbledore didn't, still it took him 3 hours to finally defeat Grindelwald in the duel.	10154903113723949_10154903882633949	2016-11-27T13:30:08+0000
After watching this movie i was like ._.
Not emotionally affected me like Harry Potter did.
Feels like just another movie with familiar names mentioned in it.

The Expanse on netflix and syfy is absolutely brilliant . The best sci fi series since BSG in my opinion. 

I can't wait for season 2.	10154901037883949_10154901528503949	2016-11-26T16:53:03+0000
I watched WESTWORLD the entire season. Will someone please explain to me the story? I see no story only tons of little situations which basically lead nowhere. Every week they make sure to kill, shoot, or blow up as many "hosts" as possible. Why? Why do they think this is an important part of the story? Shouldn't I have these answers after watching an entire season?	10154901037883949_10154901114948949	2016-11-26T14:13:44+0000
Yeah ... About that, they just keep showing the same 15 shows over and over, and over on a loop. I have over a 1000 movies in my library, I can watch movies 24 hours a day for nearly 75 days without commercial interruption. I'll binge on my own, thanks but no thanks.	10154901037883949_10154904101268949	2016-11-27T15:00:20+0000
falling skys was one of the best sci-fi show iv seen in a while	10154901037883949_10154901143358949	2016-11-26T14:22:05+0000
Some right stinkers there lol. Fringe, Firefly and Black Mirror I'll give you though.	10154901037883949_10154901145128949	2016-11-26T14:22:34+0000
Nice list but I would include THE ADVENTURES OF BRISCO COUNTY JR. -- not pure SciFi but great for binging.	10154901037883949_10154901742918949	2016-11-26T18:29:16+0000
I've just started on The Expanse. Two episodes in. Really good so far. Cross between Battlestar Galactica and Firefly	10154901037883949_10154901512138949	2016-11-26T16:43:53+0000
Based on all these comments, I really need to checkout The Expanse. Lol	10154901037883949_10154903029698949	2016-11-27T04:35:15+0000

i got bored of the zombie apocalypse years ago. Zombies were great as a subgenre of horror, now the Z.A. its basically its own full genre. The people still alive are always way worse than the zombies anyway.	10154891406688949_10154900770588949	2016-11-26T10:58:25+0000
Zombie films are like any other horror film. The entertainment factor is based on likability of characters and threat level of the zombies. 

That's why Walking Dead is so boring with its irritating cardboard characters you wish would die, and dead that...walk. Any one who gets killed by a walking zombie deserves to die.	10154891406688949_10154902402818949	2016-11-26T23:03:34+0000

Zombieland and Shaun Of The Dead are the best zombie movies ever created.	10154891406688949_10154900544203949	2016-11-26T07:56:43+0000
Twelve Monkeys? A zombie movie? I've watched the movie several times...did I miss something?

The most beautiful people you'll ever meet aren't always the ones who catch your eyes first. No, the most beautiful are the ones that can never be figured out. The one you could talk with for many hours and still have a million things to ask. The people who have mind so lovely and special, you can help but fall in love with them.	10154899905408949_10154899933573949	2016-11-26T01:52:26+0000
