sid gold's request room	"There's some important stuff going on here." Visiting artist David Cale write this moving post, which beautifully captures some of what makes our community so special. He is here as part of a new work we commissioned from Stew & Heidi that is being developed in residency this week. Thanks to all the members of our community who joined Joe McGinty on stage for Sid Gold's Request Room. You made some magic happen.

David Cale: "The first day at NYU Abu Dhabi I visited Aysan Celik's class to talk to them about my work. There were fifteen or so students in the class. Every one from a different country. No two from the same place of origin. That alone was incredible to me. Tonight as part of Stew & The Negro Problem and Heidi Rodewald's residency for us to work on their new show, "Mosquito Net Play", Joe McGinty presented an Abu Dhabi version of his Sid Gold's Request Room. All different nationalities got up and sang live karaoke. Joe's sensitivity, and the fact he really listens to the performer and responds accordingly and supportively, combined with his amazing playing expertise, brought out one surprising performance after another. What I assumed would be a light, fun evening became way more substantial and deep. Hearing young people from all around the world sing popular songs took on a new profundity and when a young girl got up to sing "Imagine there's no countries. It isn't hard to do..." to this audience of young people from all over globe the whole brilliantly curated enterprise, for me, basically left the ground. There's some important stuff going on here."

Yes, yes, yes. So much yes.	729548380461731_1180666305349934	2016-11-07T10:41:11+0000

We call ourselves Freshmex because we make everything from scratch each morning from the freshest ingredients available. From the  produce delivered from the food terminal to our blocks of cheese we hand grate to our meats we get delivered several times a week fresh!

Mmmuseumm: the smallest, quirkiest museum in New York City
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you ask someone what they think about New York City, they'll undoubtedly have an opinion.  For those seduced by the city's many charms, the response will probably be that of hackneyed superlatives.  Naysayers, on the other hand, will issue a laundry list of grievances.  You’ll hear any number of things, but I'd be willing to bet “boring” won't be one of them.   [  589 more words ]

Last fall many of you made a generous pledge to House Rabbit Society? through your workplace campaign. The money we receive from these pledges helps us rescue rabbits from euthanasia lists around the country and provide them with medical and other care they need to be healthy and adopted into a loving forever home. We hope you will consider a pledge to House Rabbit Society again this year so that we can continue this important work!
