I mean, Thanos will rip Vision's head off, and take away a very important source of Strange's powers. And after they defeat Thanos, they will have the stones back? I mean, because if they don't, that means there won't be an Eye of Agamotho anymore and Vision actually end dead because, well, the stone is what gives him life, as far as we know.	1823991741156386_1824039974484896	2016-11-15T20:25:58+0000

doctor strange	was i the only one who got excited when Dr Strange picked up Prester John's Evil Eye? But he didn't know how to use it. The Evil Eye was a part of the original Avengers/Defenders fight. The modern TV Defenders are so much weaker than the original we could never see that Marvel story. Although everyone is saying Valkyrie is introduced in Ragnarok. it will be interesting if she shows up on Marvel tv. It seems Wong was using the Wand of Wantoomb. Somebody said they saw the Black Knight's sword. And how about how the dark dimension had a very Ditko vibe?	1823991741156386_1825292277692999	2016-11-18T22:00:13+0000

"Dormammu! I've come to MUTHAFUCKING BARGAIN."	1823626417859585_677595249072849	2016-11-14T23:40:17+0000
doctor strange	Was I the only one laughing when Strange goes before Dormammu saying " I've come to bargain" only to be immediately rebuked by Dormammu and instantly 187ed? Don't know why that's funny to me.	1823626417859585_1823635287858698	2016-11-14T20:26:18+0000
doctor strange	You know what I was thinking. Would dormammu even be aware of the time loop? The people that Dr. Strange reversed in time weren't aware anything had happened. Not knocking the movie I loved it but this stuck out.	1823626417859585_1823628784526015	2016-11-14T20:07:03+0000

doctor strange	To anyone not aware. The book Stan Lee is reading in his cameo is "The Doors Of Preception". The reason this is a "Psycadelic" movie is because the book is about Aldus Huxleys experiences with Mescaline and how it alters conciousness. Read the book and eat Peyote and youll get a much deeper appreciation of the message behind this incredible work of art.	1823143134574580_1823277031227857	2016-11-14T00:13:24+0000
doctor strange	OK, Marvel ... WTF? We saw Doctor Strange on Nov. 3, and like everyone else, caught the "35 year old Marine Colonel injured while wearing experimental armor" and at first thought it referred to Rhodey. However, on further contemplation - backed by director Scott Derrickson's statements - it was realized that it is NOT Rhodey, as he is Air Force, not a Marine, and he is quite a bit older than 35. 

So last night, we went to see it again ... and the line was changed to "Air Force colonel" ... so seriously, WTF???	1823143134574580_1823170391238521	2016-11-13T18:31:38+0000

doctor strange	Benedict Cumberbatch was only credited for portraying Doctor Strange in the film. The fact that he also portrayed Dormammu was revealed by Scott Derrickson in an interview with IGN. Cumberbatch's voice was blended with another actor's, to make it harder to tell it was him. The director said he was unable to recall who the other actor was, only that he was also British.	1822789937943233_1823302884558605	2016-11-14T01:49:23+0000

doctor strange	If someone ever again makes fun of "energy workers", mediums, spiritual teachers and the like, I am sooooo shoving this film into their face!!! :)  Of course there are douchebags everywhere, that's why you train your gut feeling and your intuition to know them. This film might just be one of the biggest break throughs in cinema. Because without using the "bad words" like I just did it tells you just about EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW. Thank you so much for that.	1822717477950479_1822997551255805	2016-11-13T08:37:02+0000

doctor strange	I loved the movie it was spectacular! 
Though I am having a bit of trouble understanding the timeline...  When does the movie take place?  We know he had the car accident around the same time when civil war took place however, the movie does not really explain how long he took to recover from it but I would imagine it took a long time. So does this movie take place like a year or more after civil war?	1821277671427793_1821417358080491	2016-11-10T04:46:29+0000

doctor strange	I had never heard of Dr. Strange before seeing the trailers for the movie. One of my grandsons is an expert in Marvel/DC characters and I've seen several of the movies w/him, so he explained a little about Dr. Strange. I was very intrigued and saw the movie on Friday...it was fabulous! I've never been much of a fan of Cumberbatch, but think this role was made for him...he was perfect and I'm now a big fan. Lots of action, interesting characters played by a great cast, good story and writing, phenomenal CGI,  unexpected humor in just the right dose...what's not to like? I may go see it again! Some scenes were so spellbinding (saw it on an Ultra screen), that I felt like I was in an IMAX movie with mild vertigo. Don't know if I could've handled it in 3D but others might find that even more enjoyable! Know there will be others and can't wait!	1819683718253855_1819798431575717	2016-11-06T22:05:40+0000
doctor strange	Literally walked into the theatre last night without a clue as to what this was about. I had never heard of Doctor Strange. I was pleasantly surprised & amazed!!! And I normally hate seating through movies. 

Seriously worth it :)	1819683718253855_1819824328239794	2016-11-06T23:08:10+0000
doctor strange	Dr. Strange was one of my favorite heroes when I read comics as a kid some 40 years ago. I can't wait to see the film though I don't like the choice of the actor playing him. Dr. Strange was in a group like the Avengers called The Defenders. That's where the Hulk was with Valkyrie. All the other members of the Defenders changed consistently. I was astonished & elated when I 1st heard Dr. Strange was a movie.	1819683718253855_1819694444919449	2016-11-06T18:24:32+0000
doctor strange	Wonderful and Amazing Escapist Entertainment..(Y) (Y) Treat for the eyes to watch...(Y) Trippe, Weird, Amazing and Jaw dropping..Without giving away too much, Benedict Cumberbatch just kills it. #Cumberbatch rocks as Strange and pulls it off with ease. The impressions his portrayal gives us is that he was born to play the role of the ex-neurosurgeon turned Sorcerer Supreme. A solid new character introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe with loads of potential. It was so incredible watching this scenes with million pieces moving yet focus sing on the main characters. Wide angles, long shots and great choreography.This movie had a solid story and you believed what, how and why things were going on! Villain was good and actually a memorable one for once.It was not flawless though. The pace kind of slows down before the final act which was unnecessary.Cinematography/VFX 10/10: The images in this film blew my mind! There is a scene in the beginning where the ancient one shows Dr strange "the magic" and it is great! Some serious mind-bending stuff combined with great visuals to let it manifest itself to the audience. Most artistic movie yet of marvel.Overall, i'd give this movie an 8.5. Though this isn't THE best marvel movie, it is truly one of best out there.. :) :)	1819683718253855_1819721524916741	2016-11-06T19:44:46+0000
doctor strange	It’s vaguely reminiscent of that scene from Inception, you think to yourself. But you don’t know half of what's about to hit you....Marvels is a well oiled machine to this point...hope it carries on.Thumbs up for the Strange Doctor (Y)	1819683718253855_1820174348204792	2016-11-07T15:33:18+0000
doctor strange	the way magic was introduced was amazing. the fx team deserves a award. the dimensions  were awesome as well very trippy. i never read doctor strange but this was wild	1819683718253855_1819935018228725	2016-11-07T04:14:48+0000

doctor strange	Watched it 2 days ago, it was about 50 people seated(small town) for the movie.
When the credits start, half the people get up and leave..
And after the mid-credit scene, all the rest except myself leaves..
So I sat there alone and read the credits as they rolled by, waiting for the end-credit scene. My wait was not in vain.
But why does people leave? Do they not appreciate a good movie to its full extent?	1819683718253855_1820197831535777	2016-11-07T16:18:26+0000
doctor strange	Saw it  last night good movie great effects and action the mirror scene was cool but it kinda made feel emotion sick to my stomach i enjoy the movie but hate blair witch type of movies too me think whole route camera was little too much for me  but movie was good i enjoy was glad didn't see it in 3D because of one part ! also one another thing don't expect much characters development !	1819683718253855_1820196768202550	2016-11-07T16:14:43+0000

doctor strange	WOW!!!!!! That movie was incredible! Different from every Marvel movie, this film is trippy, bizarre and a psychedelic surreal mind bender through the multidimensional path! Benedict Cumberbatch did a wonderful performance as the title character!

doctor strange	This very moment Tibetans are being oppressed, kept in prison, driven out of their monasteries; tortured and murdered by the CHINESE GOVERNMENT. For the mere reason of profit Marvel Studio, namely screenwriter C. Robert Cargill, indeed GO POLITICAL and decide to SUPPORT THE MURDERERS in Beijing in their effort to eradicate the Tibetan culture  by removing a Tibetan character from Doctor Strange.

doctor strange	Wonderful and Amazing Escapist Entertainment..(Y) (Y) Treat for the eyes to watch...(Y) Trippe, Weird, Amazing and Jaw dropping..Without giving away too much, Benedict Cumberbatch just kills it. #Cumberbatch rocks as Strange and pulls it off with ease. The impressions his portrayal gives us is that he was born to play the role of the ex-neurosurgeon turned Sorcerer Supreme. A solid new character introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe with loads of potential. It was so incredible watching this scenes with million pieces moving yet focus sing on the main characters. Wide angles, long shots and great choreography.This movie had a solid story and you believed what, how and why things were going on! Villain was good and actually a memorable one for once.It was not flawless though. The pace kind of slows down before the final act which was unnecessary.Cinematography/VFX 10/10: The images in this film blew my mind! There is a scene in the beginning where the ancient one shows Dr strange "the magic" and it is great! Some serious mind-bending stuff combined with great visuals to let it manifest itself to the audience. Most artistic movie yet of marvel.Overall, i'd give this movie an 8.5.

doctor strange	Hey Robert Cargill, Tibet IS a place, where China is committing genocide and trying to exterminate an entire culture of peaceful people.  How telling that you chose to humor the Chinese and erase any mention of Tibet from your movie, instead of being faithful to the comic as well as the basic theme in all comics - good will prevail over evil. Marvel is implicitly endorsing China’s occupation of Tibet and the suppression of its people by removing a Tibetan character from the big screen. If you're in bed with China, Cargill, I don't want to see your movie.	1818838311671729_1819097721645788	2016-11-05T14:46:45+0000

doctor strange	A heavily religious movie, like all other comic book movies, based entirely on the kaaballah, hinduism, and buddhism (also, witchcraft). Yet atheists will flock to the theaters and worship their gods in spandex at every one of their "mecca's" called, "Comic con." Yet they claim to be against religion! LOL! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIeBKD4o2aw Think i'm joking?

doctor strange	Tibet exists; China hijacked it, and this film is going along with the crime, and condoning it. That a Tibetan character should have been travestied as Chinese just shows the cowardly stance of the studio; once again, money drives the bus, and art bowes its head in submission. That is NOT the role of art! Art is supposed to be the conscience of the times that can speak truth to power like the prophets once did. The prophets were not wealthy, nor impressed by big money. And yes, they were persecuted, but by God, they spoke truth! We are not impressed . . .	1818783405010553_1818796321675928	2016-11-05T00:54:43+0000
doctor strange	Chinese film goers should be made aware that Tibet does actually exist. Tibet should not be written out of the script, and Tibetan characters should not be removed in order to not offend the Chinese government.

doctor strange	I have been waiting for this movie since Marvel Studios first announced the Marvel Cinematic Universe and I am glad I was not disappointed. The humor used came across to me as a typical defense mechanisim by Dr. Strange and so worked for me. Both easter eggs were great as well.  Only regret is Tilda dying too soon but we can have her back as a ghost just as in the comics.	1818783405010553_1818818915007002	2016-11-05T01:49:19+0000

doctor strange	I am dismayed that the fictional TIBETAN  character has been swirched because of fear of "The Chinese". This huge absence of American spirit is opposite to what Marvel Comics characters promote. So much so that the UN chose Wonder Woman as a spokesperson. So American courage, can-do and independence is all just a comic?  Do you realize that a great percentage of the supporters of the best known Tibetan today, the Dalai Lama, are Chinese? Maybe it is better to ascribe to "The Chinese" the wierdness of this character so it is not mixed up with the clarity and compassion of what Tibet now represents. Nevertheless American fear of "the Chinese," all revolving around profit is extremely small-minded and small-hearted.	1818783405010553_1818857008336526	2016-11-05T03:59:52+0000

doctor strange	I wrote a pretty negative review but it probably won't see the light of day. Expecting Big Time Hollywood Blockbusters to be good? What was I thinking? Joke's on me. I want to go back in time ( the most tired cliche plot device of all time now, except for the equally tired and confused "eastern" philosophy...talk about stereotypes) and get my $ back.  Not the worst movie I've  ever seen...just the worst I've seen today.	1818783405010553_1819395181616042	2016-11-06T05:36:09+0000

doctor strange	Out of fear of what China might think, Marvel decided to cast Tilda Swinton for the Ancient One, who is originally a Tibetan character in the comics.

Responding to concerns about the identity change, screenwriter C. Robert Cargill gave this incredibly problematic statement:

"[Ancient One] originates from Tibet. So if you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he's Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people who think that that's bulls—t and risk the Chinese government going, 'Hey, you know one of the biggest film-watching countries in the world? We're not going to show your movie because you decided to get political.'"

Mr. Cargill must know - Tibet does exist and so do Tibetans, in spite of China’s efforts to curtail their rights and cultural identity. To this day, Tibetans inside Tibet and in exile are struggling to sustain their culture and identity due to China’s violent occupation of Tibet.	1818690325019861_1818740101681550	2016-11-04T21:58:18+0000

doctor strange	Even in so-called Communst China, they acknowledge Tibet exists (but as a part of China). They acnowledge that the "minority" who live in the so-called "TIBET AUTONOMOUS REGION" are called "Tibetans". Therefore, it is stranger than Dr Strange that Marvel Films and C. Robert Cargill could be so dumb and supine as to delete the words Tibet and Tibetan from the script, supposedly in order to please the Chinese people. Please note 1) it is only the Communist Party of China that is militarily subjugating Tibet into being part of China. 2) Even the Communist Party Members refer to Tibet as an Autonomous Region and call its inhabitants "ethnic Tibetans" ad 3) the people of China are by and large fully aware that Tibet is different from China and Tibetans are different from Han Chinese people.

In view of your undescribably stupid policy to airbrush the words Tibet and Tibetan from your script, I shall boycott this film and campaign amongst all my friends that it should be criticised and boycotted. Shame on you!	1818690325019861_1818942028328024	2016-11-05T08:40:08+0000

Also where the heck did Brad pitt take the Aether to that guys has more bases then Groot says I am Groot. The rest of course are safe at least for now although it would be cool and dangerous if in one of these three movies we find out Thanos found the last stone plus he has the gauntlet.	1818681711687389_1818786018343625	2016-11-05T00:10:07+0000

doctor strange	Brilliant from the start with the new Marvel intro to the end when a familiar face drops in for a beer,it seemed short which is a good thing but we need more always loved the comic book and Cumberbatch looks great as Doctor Strange with a bit of Sherlock thrown in.	1818536141701946_1818553305033563	2016-11-04T14:31:28+0000

doctor strange	Doctor Strange is one of the best films of the fall! One of the best MCU films yet! The best MCU origin story since Thor! Benedict Cumberbatch's best performance yet! The cast is electrifying! A visual odyssey! Wondrous to behold! A must-see! However, some of the humor didn't work and was unnecessary. And, the villain could have been better along with more backstory. 9/10.	1818536141701946_1819562508265976	2016-11-06T14:15:53+0000

doctor strange	I got to see this on Sunday. The first film I've seen in the theater in 2016. As a long time fan of the comics (I've got a full original run from the first appearance in Strange Tales), my hopes were high just from the trailer. I not only was not at all dissapointed... I was blown away. Absolutely spectacular!!! And visually mind-bending just as one would expect it to be with the mid 20-teens effects capabilities meeting the late 1960s psychedelia. Absolutely phenomenal. The moment it ended... I wanted to sit right back down & watch it all over again. And worth waiting for BOTH post title teasers.	1818536141701946_1820379798184247	2016-11-07T23:26:06+0000
doctor strange	Loved the film, but have one complaint: I don't recall a single use of any of Stan Lee's memorable spell chants! No "By the Hoary Hosts of Hoggoth!" or "By the Ruby Rings of Raggador!"  Saving those for the sequel?! :)	1818536141701946_1818594831696077	2016-11-04T15:54:48+0000

arrival	Cinephile Friday: THE AWARD SEASON BEGINS

Alongside the holiday blockbusters taking over the majority of seasonal multiplex screens, December for film buffs is the start of the "Best of the Year" conversation. Steelehouse Lead Creative Jeff Huston gives us insightful reporting on the first three critics groups out of the gate. 

The National Board of Review picked Kenneth Lonnergan's contemplative Manchester By The Sea as its Best of 2016 while the New York Film Critics Circle (NYFCC) gave the glory to Damien Chazelle's musical tour de force La La Land.

Both pictures fared well in the just released nominations for the 22nd Annual Critics' Choice Awards, which also honored Arrival, Moonlight, and Loving.

Read up on Jeff's take as we await his choices for the ten best of the year.	64161396793_10154164889881794	2016-12-02T13:29:54+0000
arrival	Så ankommer Episode 61, sammen med Arrival - en af de film vi har glædet os mest til i år. Derudover ser vi om der er julehygge i Bad Santa 2, og om det er bedst at snige eller hakke i Dishonored 2. Og så har vi en top 3 over de computerspil, vi gerne så filmatiseret, og så løfter vi lidt af sløret for vores kommende Kraften Vækkes lydbånd. God fornøjelse <3 Jacob & Elias

suicide squad	A man is driving down the road and his car breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, "My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?" The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, "We can't tell you. You're not a monk." Distraught, the man is forced to leave. Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again. The monks reply, "We can't tell you. You're not a monk." The man says, "If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk." The monks reply, "You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk." The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray- haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks. "In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception." The monks reply, "Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound." The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, "The sound is beyond that door." The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, "This is the last key to the last door." The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door! With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound...... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.	1823985131215453_1824072307873402	2016-12-03T03:58:45+0000

suicide squad	Margot Robbie was fantastic as Harley Quinn and everyone else was good to. But in my opinion she stole the show can't wait to see more of her and Jared Leto's joker if he decides to come back that is please come back.	1823293121284654_1823326321281334	2016-12-01T18:13:41+0000

suicide squad	I cosplayed because she is not a weak character, she seens like a rebell and she's kinda crazy which separates her from the perfect women image. Her outfit is not too sexualized. Just only wished she'd be kinda free from Joker and find her own way from the beginnig. Bc a story with Harley is already interesting and does not depend on Joker.	1823293121284654_1823693824577917	2016-12-02T11:19:23+0000

suicide squad	Enchantress is my personal favorite but I hated how they made her the villain of this movie.

suicide squad	She was the best character before her transformation later. I didn't like the movie tbh and I hated that she was the villian ? She really needs a solo movie with everything what happened before. I would so watch it!	1822657911348175_1823152884632011	2016-12-01T12:26:02+0000

suicide squad	what can I say....Im pretty disapointed in the extended cut, theres still so many scenes in the Trailer that isnt really in the movie....I love DC and eventhough its kinda disapointing that this happened Im still going to buy this extended cut	1816112262002740_1816119088668724	2016-11-17T17:02:40+0000
suicide squad	Extended scenes flesh out the characters and make the whole thing gel together. I enjoyed the theatrical version but will only watch the extended cut from this point.	1816112262002740_1816493138631319	2016-11-18T10:35:08+0000

suicide squad	0 for 3 DC. I love DC but you have disappointed me for the last time. Stick to TV shows and animated movies instead. I see Wonder Woman being a failure too.	1816112262002740_1816195271994439	2016-11-17T19:26:03+0000

suicide squad	The Extended Cut's only 12 minutes longer.. why couldn't they have atleast done what they did with BvS Ultimate edition and made it an extra 30 minutes longer...	1815772502036716_1815778592036107	2016-11-16T23:21:33+0000
suicide squad	I liked this movie, I wish they would have put the true Mad Love relationship back in, but I understand appealing to the masses. I'm sure down the road we will get Ayers Original Cut	1815772502036716_1815776078703025	2016-11-16T23:12:17+0000
suicide squad	i did like some of the new scenes but the issue is a lot of scenes that showed up in the trailers still weren't in the movie so that was a little disappointing	1815772502036716_1815780965369203	2016-11-16T23:28:54+0000
suicide squad	Seriously, why didn't they just put it all in there? If you're going to do an extended cut, then just go all out. I mean if there's enough Joker material to make a whole movie, then I don't see the harm in adding at least 30 minutes to the cut instead of 12. Make it worth it.	1815772502036716_1816284111985555	2016-11-17T22:34:05+0000
suicide squad	You might as well wait until the directors cut (if there will be such a thing) because the extended cut wasn't too different.	1815772502036716_1815780448702588	2016-11-16T23:25:55+0000

suicide squad	I hate that all these digital releases get out like a month before it should be like 2 weeks or a week like Jesus it's stupid I like physical copies of my movies	1815772502036716_1815800605367239	2016-11-17T00:17:44+0000
suicide squad	One more Harley flashback scene, a Harley being obnoxious to the team scene and a few moments dragged out a little longer does not a better movie make.	1815772502036716_1815775985369701	2016-11-16T23:12:09+0000
suicide squad	I already have it and I watched it twice in a row last night. I love the additional material and I think it would have been so worth to play the two hour long movie with all the extras in the theaters! ?????

suicide squad	Got it at about 12:10 a.m. Loved the additions. Wish there had been a little more Joker. There was a scene of him in the trailer throwing a grenade or something that I wish I knew the context of.	1815165675430732_1815167062097260	2016-11-15T17:06:30+0000

suicide squad	Loved the extended but still leaves you wanted the Grenade scene with his burnt face AND where he smacks harleen quinzel. Other than that I'm happy with the extended cut! Added just enough to make it not lack joker but not overflow it with him. Hopefully he gets a film for himself with Batfleck	1815165675430732_1815198332094133	2016-11-15T18:15:52+0000

the secret life of pets	I would be MUCH more interested in this animated movie were it not for the PG rating! Great...rude humor...just the opposite of what I try to teach my kids. Too bad it can't be funny and amusing without it...:/	827301867417536_828148067332916	2016-11-29T14:39:20+0000
the secret life of pets	AAAHH my fiance and I are super excited for this movie. It looks SOO good.
It's also interesting to see a different studio's take on the whole Zootopia-esque idea, especially since y'all have primates and non-mammals in this one. I hope more movies like this will be made, they're so creative.	827301867417536_827830307364692	2016-11-29T04:40:54+0000

captain america: civil war	When Batman V. Superman came out and I saw it, I Really Love the movie because for instant, the movie didn't need to tell us that Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent already knew their identity, that first moment they met, I knew they already know their secret, but people complain that the movie didn't do a good job pointing that out, Hello!!!! Even Lex Luther got in on the fun knowing the truth and introducing them....	712723172212029_712953075522372	2016-12-02T17:12:19+0000
captain america: civil war	honestly, i think both franchises have their positives and negatives, but when i see posts like this that insult the other it lowers my opinion of the people following the franchise. if you want more people to like your fandom, be the bigger person. honestly marvel is just as bad for this type of thing, and that's why, if you truly believe that dc is better, you have to be better.	712723172212029_712964612187885	2016-12-02T17:38:41+0000

jurassic world	The new Jurassic Park films are nothing  compared to the original two, The casting of the first movie was spot on, The grand kids were great, But all the adult characters were good, I still remember seeing it at 6 years old, My brother and his friends took me to see it, Every seat was filled and I remember some woman was there with her son screaming at the intense scene with Laura Dern So epic !	1285333228178224_1286802594697954	2016-11-30T21:07:54+0000
jurassic world	All the Jurassic movies have their own stand alone storylines, although seeing the previous ones does help but not really necessary.
The latest movie Jurassic World, is a good example of this.
Not everyone has the same thoughts and opinion regarding these movies and indeed all movies, but surely all these style of fantasy movies should be taken and viewed as a piece of Escapism for a couple of hours and viewed for its entertainment content.
To many people take these movies to seriously, almost as if it's a documentary.
Just sit back and enjoy these movies for what they are intended for Entertainment ... M	1285333228178224_1287298157981731	2016-12-01T10:00:29+0000

finding dory	I missed seeing this part in Finding Dory. This part could the bloopers, the sequel, extended version, the out-takes, the ending that That wasn't seen in the movie, extras, and bonus features. He doesn't see very happy and satisfied with his perfect gift, I think Dory lost her memory again and forgot to give a manly gift for he is a manly fish! He is a clown fish, so I see why the shell hat looks funny on him, but Dory is the only one smiling and laughing at him. She is definitely is a womanly fish and yet she is so serious and yet has no clue what a manly fish wants. Dory needs a reality check and The clown fish needs some entertainment and is getting bored with Dory right now! There are plenty of shell hats in the occean, it atleast had some color to it and that's the only gift you could get the clown fish. Awe, common Dory, the clown fish deserves better like pretend shell hat is a music instrument like play it like its a drum or horn and the clown fish will laugh and be entertained for today and will be the perfect gift for the clown fish. That's what I think the shell hat could be and I can remember that, Dory! ??. Now you get Dory, keep it in your mind, so you want forget it this time, next time, or ever. Bye, Dory.	1033210223454952_1033899806719327	2016-11-29T08:34:23+0000

finding dory	I'm so disappointed in the The Disney Store online ordering company. I pre purchased two of the Finding Dory CDs with litho. They only shipped one and WILL NOT send the other. They said there are no replacements. It wouldn't be a replacement if I already paid and ordered it a couple months ago. So, so disappointed.	1019536681488973_1019568711485770	2016-11-16T18:46:17+0000

finding dory	just curious~ I'm pretty sure i saw some scene in theatre but i don't see them in dvd anymore, did some of the scenes got cut???? i don't see the reason why and they're not put back as bonus either
for eg, dory's sleep swimming (is in the trailers) and destiny said she gets to tells story over and over again cause dory don't remember (am sure i saw that in theatre)	1018051558304152_1024987087610599	2016-11-22T08:25:18+0000
finding dory	I've got a question. The creators said they have at least 2 Die Hard references in the movie and people have been trying to find them with no luck. Well, I've watched it 3 times now and I'm still at a loss. 
The only things I can come up with, and this is a stretch, are the little creatures in the touch tank saying "hands" and Dory thinks they're saying "Hans" like the villain in Die Hard, and the traveling through the pipes like Bruce Willis did in the air vents. 

That's all I've got. Anybody else have any ideas. I can't be right.	1018051558304152_1019463188162989	2016-11-16T15:43:04+0000

big hero 6	Someone tried to guess the plot of Big Hero 6 based on the title and it’s an interesting attempt:	154132781425607_626683524170528	2016-11-08T17:00:05+0000
big hero 6	I love the Big Hero 6 guess! That would be entertaining to watch. But how about this:

Hiro goes off to find his brother Tadashi who has gone missing and the only link to the mystery is Tadashi's robot friend Baymax who keeps leading them into all sorts of trouble and Hiro ends up meeting the other "nerds" (Honey Lemon, Wasabi, Go-Go, Fred) who are basically all alone until they find each other and together they find Tadashi who as it turns out has been kidnapped by a whole colony of Baymaxses who are searching for their one missing robot aka Tadashi's Baymax. Then they all get to be heroes and live with the Baymaxses!!!!!! 

Christine Flesch What do you think? I think Disney should hire me to be a writer, no joke ?	626683524170528_626865607485653	2016-11-09T02:05:33+0000

big hero 6	Am I the only one who thinks they should also make a Zootopia buddy-cop show with Nick and Judy?

Either way, this looks awesome! :)	624315387740675_624336101071937	2016-11-03T16:01:19+0000
big hero 6	Great to see 90% of the main cast back! Khary Payton is a great voice actor as well so I'm sure he'll be a good choice for Wasabi.	624315387740675_624317554407125	2016-11-03T15:15:58+0000
big hero 6	Am I the only one who feels that they should just leave this as a movie? Like even a sequel would be okay, but I've noticed that cartoons kinda ruin the movie that they're based off of. Example: Kung Fu Panda	624315387740675_624375547734659	2016-11-03T17:41:48+0000
big hero 6	Big Hero 6 is one of my utmost favorites, so I was worried about how they would transition this into 2D (especially that it would be too simplistic), but this looks actually really really decent. Plus almost all of the original actors are back for the show, AND bringing in some fantastic familiar faces/voices for additional cast. I'm excited now! All that's left is some really good writing to do the film justice. I'm watching you, Disney.	624315387740675_624361721069375	2016-11-03T17:05:04+0000
big hero 6	So glad that Scott Adsit, Jaimie Chung, Alan Tudyk and even Stan Lee will reprise their roles. Too bad T.J. Miller won't but I hope his replacement will do fine.	624315387740675_624338311071716	2016-11-03T16:06:24+0000
big hero 6	Hm, Andrew Scott as the Big Bad of the show. I'm DEFINITELY looking forward to this. As long as his character is not going to be a expy of Moriarty or that guy from SPECTRE I am fine with it. ;)	624315387740675_624358404403040	2016-11-03T16:55:36+0000

[Please no stupid teen stuff, please, pleeeease. Let "love" out of this. Just this time, please? Pleeease. <3 Please.

Fred may not be a college student for serious but he is a positive for that campus -not to mention his dad probably gave the college campus $$ for Fred to be there and do what he does... any way it is one of several things I think Fred does "off story"... Fred is where the story ought to follow for awhile...	619328028239411_619498131555734	2016-10-24T21:09:18+0000

interstellar	This is one of the best movie scores I've ever heard, and I watched more than a thousand movies before. Without a doubt Hans Zimmer will win with this gorgeous piece of art this time...  After that absurd Oscar snub, the chances of winning are quite big this time considering all the other nominees aren't as strong as this haunting, inspiring score.

Interstellar were even better..  Without hans zimmer that movie would not have same impact on people.

interstellar	i like christopher nolan because the way he came with his movies and scripts that was really awesome like inception,dark knight rises,the prestige,man of steel,batman begins........etc.interstellar was one of the movie came from his thoughts,cooper had done well with his performance and murph plays vital role in this film,entire film evolves around warm hole the concept was awesome man.I think this movie will get oscar at least one place at	1156813157679706_1157253367635685	2015-12-09T16:57:21+0000
interstellar	Awesome sound track, Bought it right away last year and have listened to it at least 10 times through. Seem the movie now 5 times through. It beats out the Martian hands down. Martian was ok but not nearly as good as Interstellar. Damon should not have taken on the Martian and Interstellar, he should have picked one space movie and moved on. I think doing both actually made the Martian worse. or vise versa. If he didn't like being the bad guy in space then he should have let the Dr. Mann character go to someone else. Interstellar is still the best movie of the last 10 years.	1156813157679706_1156817217679300	2015-12-08T21:09:25+0000

interstellar	This pic of adult Murph reminds me that Interstellar Movie sends a positive message to girls and young women: You CAN pursue a career in science and technology AND succeed at it! I don't know if the makers of Interstellar Movie intended this, but I think it's a strong statement, and important, in an era where girls are often made to feel that science and math are areas they don't belong in.	1130413383653017_1178550722172616	2016-01-13T05:25:05+0000

interstellar	I'm not a troll trying to spoil the fun but I hate this movie. it was boring and nonsensical. I didn't understand what was going on. it was one boring scene after the other. and I hated that robot voice. they voice sounded like a trucker or handyman. robots are supposed to sound smart like a Brit. I didn't understand was matt damon was trying to do. it sucked like the Dark Knight Rises. If they make a sequel, christopher Nolan needs to let someone else direct it. Like the Battlestar guys or Game of throne guys.	1101997143161308_1128297390531283	2015-10-11T10:25:07+0000

interstellar	Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.	1027275593966797_1027285567299133	2015-04-13T20:06:07+0000

interstellar	I think the movie, overall, is very good (except the error I messaged earlier). I especially liked the dark humor of the robot, TARS. After their blast-off from  Earth and the separation of the first stage, TARS asks; "Is everybody good? Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?" That's hilarious! And then,"I have a cue light I can use when I'm joking if you like, (an indicator lights on TARS' display panel). "You can use it to find your way back to the ship after I blow you out the air-lock." That's funny... as long as the robot in MY spaceship doesn't say that! I guess it all depends on your (relative) point of view!	1027275593966797_1028958997131790	2015-04-17T00:15:27+0000

terminator genisys	Terminator Genisys is not only hot garbage, but it can't spell and is IN FACT a rehash of the first Terminator. Sorry but dude is hack and just salty because people stopped caring about Avatard 10 minutes after they left the theater, and will never be as successful as franchise as Star Wars, Terminator or Alien. Jesus what a fucking hypocrite.	1253797017994401_1253826914658078	2016-07-25T05:51:43+0000

But I do hope that next Alien movie gets the franchise back on track.	1253797017994401_1254336737940429	2016-07-25T20:29:12+0000

the revenant	That was a very good movie worthy of a Oscar but everybody knows Leonardo DiCaprio don't suck dick. And everybody loves The Wolf of Wall Street regardless of your feminist sexist racist whatever everybody loves that damn movie.	851605164973384_851607634973137	2016-08-01T22:53:56+0000
the revenant	I'm tired of seeing hypocrites commenting, "Why are they watching this kind of movie"

If they understand that its just a movie its fine stop acting like you never watched an R rated film as a kid. I let my children watch all kinds of films.	851605164973384_851611948306039	2016-08-01T23:09:17+0000
the revenant	This has to be Di Caprio's finest work.It must have been real real hard to shoot in such hostile terrain.The Grizzly bear attack & Di caprio taking shelter inside the horse's stomach had numbed my body as i was watching.awesome!!! 10 stars for this movie.	851605164973384_851705291630038	2016-08-02T01:21:26+0000
the revenant	one of the best films ever made...one of the best films a teen could ever watch. if this is what teens chose, it gives one pause and much more hope for their particular generation than I even had before...	851605164973384_851977588269475	2016-08-02T13:19:32+0000
the revenant	My favourite movie... saw it four times
Once at cinema and three times at home
...really it's epic performance	851605164973384_851639381636629	2016-08-02T00:27:57+0000
the revenant	Haha how did this win an award at the teen choice awards? Most of em can't even watch the damn movie without being accompanied by an adult lol	851605164973384_852042831596284	2016-08-02T15:31:37+0000

the revenant	Great movie! Leonardo truly out did himself on this one. The scenery,relism of survival...that bear attack scene had us on the edge of our seats. Fantastic movie!	851605164973384_851909204942980	2016-08-02T11:13:18+0000
the revenant	Good movie, but the actual event took place in the summer, or he would have starved/froze to death.  As soon as I saw that huge depiction mistake, I just shook my head.  His survival was so epic anyway.  Why not show the truth of it!	851605164973384_852063524927548	2016-08-02T15:56:29+0000

the revenant	He didn't have a son, and wasn't involved with an Indian woman. He didn't go after the guys that left him for dead, but he forgave em, but indians did kill Glass. Hollywood ruins everything. Always trying to make whites look racist	828635103937057_829517717182129	2016-06-19T18:57:43+0000
the revenant	Watched this for the first time this past weekend. WOW! Awesome film and superb acting! The contrast of nature's stupendous beauty and raw brutality was perfectly crafted in this film. It was a haunting portrayal. Well done!	828635103937057_849530101847557	2016-07-29T03:51:47+0000
the revenant	So someone help answer my question. Why did Tom Hardy stay behind with Will Poulter, Leo and the actor who played his son when everyone thought he was going to die. Ik Tom's character is bad but did he want him dead from the very beginning when the movie started? If someone can answer this it would be very greatly appreciated.	828635103937057_831038110363423	2016-06-23T00:56:40+0000

the revenant	I won't be the first to acknowledge this, but in the beginning of the film,  Hugh Glass is being choked by a rifle, and a faceless man saves him. It is a chance this was Fitzgerald.	824683504332217_836458896488011	2016-07-04T02:37:01+0000

the revenant	Loved this movie. Brilliant acting from Leo and Tom. Alejandro direction brings Hugh Glass to life. Every scene in the movie is well crafted. Will add this movie to my watchlist again and again.	824597357674165_824623091004925	2016-06-09T18:37:22+0000
the revenant	I predict  this movie will be remembered as one of the greatest movies of all time and will become the gold standard of which future movies will ge compared. It is a masterpiece and I am so happy my favorite actor Leonardo Di Caprio  had a role in it.	824597357674165_824630721004162	2016-06-09T18:46:49+0000
the revenant	A masterpiece. Direction, acting, soundtrack. I listen to this amazing soundtrack by Sakamoto every day since I saw the film for the first time.	824597357674165_824605597673341	2016-06-09T17:25:10+0000
the revenant	I was very concerned, especially when there were no behind the scenes on the DVD release to explain how the heck the actor(s) stayed safe and alive during the bear attack! I thought the movie was a cool medical fantasy of how Mother Earth was made to become his only healer in various ways and that each tragedy led to an absolutely necessary medical process, which implied that Divine Providence or the "Universe"  was compensating him. It was a total fantasy however in this: There's no way that only his skin was punctured and that only his skin was in need of medical healing, which is what mother Earth provided for his surface injuries alone. Watch House! Every organ and every bone in his body would have been smashed. Moving around on broken ribs could spell NO GOOD.	824597357674165_827584360708798	2016-06-15T21:44:48+0000
the revenant	What an amazing piece of artwork.  It was a hard film to watch but it was also magnificient...felt so real...I was at the edge of my seat at the theatre watching...love this group photo!!!!	824597357674165_824613444339223	2016-06-09T17:57:24+0000
the revenant	this movie has taught one lesson about life which is to keep your head on top of the water and staying alive... because life is precious...	824597357674165_824784257655475	2016-06-10T01:58:24+0000
the revenant	One of the best movies to come along in years. I've watched it dozens of times with others, and just love it. The acting, the scenery, the action, watching a journey unfold in such a powerful way, it's rare in films in general these days. Tom Hardy made for such a great villain. Hell, he was even likeable at certain points, especially the whole campfire "God, he's a squirrel" scene, those psycho eyes and all. 

And Leo knocked it out of the park with aplomb. Plus it was cool to see Brendan Fletcher in it despite not having much screen time.	824597357674165_824670711000163	2016-06-09T20:46:42+0000
the revenant	Forrest Goodluck talked to our acting class. He's from ABQ NM, BREAKING BAD, BETTER CALL SAUL, DUSK 2 DAWN, NIGHT SHIFT, SICARIO, etc...all filmed here, plus BVS and STAR WARS (2nd unit only)...haha we GONNA BLOW UP HARD...	824597357674165_824616694338898	2016-06-09T18:11:34+0000

the revenant	It really bothers me that on the sticker on the cover of the Bu-rays, they showcase DiCaprio's and Inarritu's Oscar wins, but they left out Chivo's win for Cinematography, especially since the cinematography was a stand out element of the film and was worth the price of admission alone.	817522638381637_817538415046726	2016-05-26T17:42:24+0000

the revenant	Leo and the Director made the movie GREAT; as did the other's in their roles. But it was the TWO who made the movie what it was. Can anybody name another actor that could have done this role as beautifully as DiCaprio? I can't name anyone and I've seen a lot of movies. And I am one smart PhD Child Psychologist. IQ of 148, yes I'm bragging because I got my PhD from UC Berkeley at 58 years old! Last month! I did not use my husband's name neither my maiden name, I used the name I loved above all else; my Viennese Great Grandmother who graduated from it's University over 120 years ago! She was a gentle soul, an intellectual and she taught me the art of emulation.	817522638381637_818191548314746	2016-05-28T04:28:05+0000

the revenant	I just got finished watching this movie from the redbox. It was a 5/5 star movie. Good acting and good action. Although I don't think that in Real life that he would have even survived the bear Attack.	813958638738037_814179792049255	2016-05-20T03:38:34+0000

the revenant	Leo cannot make a bad movie! That Director doesn't make bad movies either. So hard work created a very good movie. Although I think Leo's many other movies were as good; why in the world he did not get an Academy Award for the Wolf of Wall Street, The Departed, and Gangs of New York; all famous and all equally as good as The Revenant, the Academy had blinders on.	813958638738037_814102055390362	2016-05-20T00:03:13+0000
the revenant	What a disappointing film.  The worst movie I have ever seen DiCaprio do I'm only glad I rented it instead of paying theatre prices to be bored to death.  Pretty snow but that is all I can say that is good about this one.  How the heck did it win any award?	813958638738037_815270291940205	2016-05-22T10:40:04+0000
the revenant	Excellent movie! Leonardo dicaprio truly is amazing. This movie kept us intrigued,on the edge of our seat,captivated,etc..wow.	813958638738037_814341238699777	2016-05-20T11:39:35+0000
the revenant	Aside from the excellent acting, nature provided the stunningly beautiful and cruel backdrop for this wonderful movie!  Challenges during filming?  DiCaprio wasn't kidding.	813958638738037_814460425354525	2016-05-20T16:21:01+0000
the revenant	What a piece of crap. I have no idea what all the fuss is about this drivel. Alright the scenery was spectacular. Period. Aside from that, it was totally unconvincing, intellectually pathetically dull, so full of holes that it made a colander loof watertight. Oscar worthy?? Definitely NOT. Mickey mouse award - maybe. I feel cheated!	813958638738037_815111948622706	2016-05-22T02:27:33+0000

Tell me anyways that I can improve on this too. :)

The Revenant is the best made film last year, very influential cinematography and choreography.  I want to do make my own Revenantesque film, and I am determined to do it even though I been filmmaking for one year and seven months.	813958638738037_815135408620360	2016-05-22T03:57:19+0000

the revenant	Awesome movie. Visually poignant. Evocative sound. Eagerly watched the featurette and appalled by the political grandstanding.  The "climate change" was a chinook which is typical of Calgary weather.	810441002423134_813897772077457	2016-05-19T14:16:18+0000

the revenant	Get the story of Hugh Glass and how it influenced the production of #TheRevenant. bit.ly/TheRevenantBr	568876783246225_806985612768673	2016-05-05T16:55:14+0000

the revenant	a movie that you can rewatch it and never gets old. They really did great job making this movie.	806985602768674_806993719434529	2016-05-05T17:17:51+0000
the revenant	Dear Lord! I had to stop the movie 30 minutes in so I could remember to breath .. I literally held my breath the first 1/2 hour ?	806985602768674_807140109419890	2016-05-06T00:46:08+0000
the revenant	In love with this film. Saw this in the cinema three times and would probably go again if I had the chance. To a visual person / photographer in me: super inspiring. To the storylover & movie fan in me: mind-blowing. 

Well, pretty much the same thing as with Birdman :)	806985602768674_807068499427051	2016-05-05T20:31:34+0000
the revenant	Best movie seen for a long time.  Could watch over and over.  Vicious, remarkable, haunting, etc ... and sad for the loss of what was :'(  Everyone involved in the making and acting deserved all the awards received. (y)	806985602768674_810164979117403	2016-05-12T03:21:48+0000
the revenant	Before seeing The Revenant, the most times I'd seen a film in the Cinema was The Dark Knight (7 times). I watched The Revenant on Vmax screen 9 times. This movie has changed me. As someone who suffers mental health issues, seeing this film multiple times, and then reading the book has given me some strength I never knew I had. It has touched me intellectually, emotionally and spiritually. I applaud everyone involved. Thank you for creating the most amazing, soulful experience of my life.	806985602768674_807202492746985	2016-05-06T03:42:59+0000
the revenant	Just finished watching it and he deserved that Oscar. Captivating from the minute it started to the time the credits rolled through. Left me shaking. Absolutely brilliantly done	806985602768674_807724942694740	2016-05-07T02:49:59+0000
the revenant	The big screw-up of the movie is that it supposedly took place in winter.  Had that been the case, Glass certainly would have died of cold/exposure quite quickly. He was attacked by the bear in summer, and that meant there was sufficient plants, bugs, and small animals for him to consume, and high enough temperatures at night that he could survive.  As soon as I saw the staging of the story in winter, I shook my head.  The film was good.  Glass's survival story is epic.  But only the most naive city people would believe that anyone could live through that in the dead of winter. He would have frozen to death within the first 24 hours - -	806985602768674_807482022719032	2016-05-06T16:10:44+0000

the revenant	These photographers were inspired by "magic hour", the same light Emmanuel Lubezki used to shoot The Revenant Movie.	568876783246225_806570686143499	2016-05-04T17:19:21+0000

the revenant	What an excellent masterpiece...equally brutal and beautiful epic!  Leo's performance is stellar and he deserves his Oscar; I think it should have won Best Picture also! Tom Hardy was excellent also.	806123959521505_809547635845804	2016-05-10T19:23:47+0000
the revenant	I applaud this piece, it is truly a work of art that enlightens the soul. I wish  all North Americans could share this experience.  As soon as my son's spirit is mature enough to handle this harsh visual reality I will show it to him. This film could be a vital educational tool and should be shown on the big screen to students.	806123959521505_811841012283133	2016-05-15T13:01:26+0000

the revenant	Its an epic movie.  watched it yesterday.. Caprio and hardy both were at their best.. Its not just a movie,it's an experience and the cinematography... Its out of the world..hats offThank u soo much for a once in a life time movie..	804229849710916_804243096376258	2016-04-29T17:16:50+0000
the revenant	I'm late to the party, but just watched it tonight.  Who knew there were still incredible stories to be told, and talented people to make them into movies?  Blown away.  Wasn't sure I'd ever see this caliber of a movie again in my lifetime.	804229849710916_804978609636040	2016-05-01T05:21:21+0000
the revenant	I enjoyed this movie very much and I really didn't think I would.  That bear scene was just insane.  Great story,  the scenes were visually stunning.    However, I still think Room was the best picture and Jacob Tremblay should've been nominated for best actor.  That child was robbed.  Anyhoo, great job, Leo.	804229849710916_805126332954601	2016-05-01T13:57:56+0000
the revenant	Okay, Leo we know about this true story after your character got his revenge for killling the murderer of your 'son' you died; You are the Revenant and everybody has always loved you. From Romeo and Juliet to the Titantic and you made magic from then on except for J Edgar. No one could play that jerk.	804229849710916_804233829710518	2016-04-29T16:52:49+0000
the revenant	There are few actors I  can think of that can make a movie... Tom Hanks, Johnny Depp and Leo.... These 3 gents need limited dialogue.... They make their movies..... Own their characters.... Amazing actors!!!	804229849710916_804459586354609	2016-04-30T05:04:13+0000
the revenant	I do believe he survided. The tears in his eyes (finally the grief comes - now the anger is gone)... Then the breathing... As he himself says: As long as you breathe - you keep fighting... And so he does!:)	804229849710916_853571041443463	2016-08-04T21:36:28+0000

the revenant	FINALLY saw the film last night...  CAN NOT get DiCaprio out of my mind!  What a performance!!  What a film - BEAUTIFULLY SHOT!!	802427236557844_802432619890639	2016-04-25T16:49:40+0000

the revenant	OMG. Just watched. Fire going, wrapped in blanket, hot tea... because I feel the cold in my bones!!! Cinematography was AMAZING. And Leo? No, he didn't deserve an Academy Award... he deserves ALL THE AWARDS!!!! WTH does he do for an encore performance? That was RIDICULOUS. WOW. <3	802427236557844_802597069874194	2016-04-26T02:40:44+0000
the revenant	All my life I thought T2 was the best movie ever.

Then I put in the Blu-ray version of the REVENANT.

No movie will ever top this.
Leo and Tom are too Good. 
And camera shots were amazing.	802427236557844_802644419869459	2016-04-26T05:39:45+0000
the revenant	After finally watching the movie today, I can say DiCaprio very much deserved the Oscar	802427236557844_802594956541072	2016-04-26T02:30:51+0000
the revenant	The Revenant is the most outstanding film I had seen last night when I buy this film on DVD, Leonardo DiCaprio did delivering his best Academy Award winning performance as Hugh Glass and Tom Hardy is incredible.	802427236557844_802445509889350	2016-04-25T17:36:32+0000
the revenant	What an incredible film!!!! Hands down best performance I've ever seen from Leo!	802427236557844_803914036409164	2016-04-29T00:27:07+0000

the revenant	The writer, screen play, production, and acting sums up to one word!  GENIUS!!  Leonardo was spectacular!  I give this movie 2 thumbs up!!  Great job!  Love it!	800926116707956_801185706681997	2016-04-23T04:27:59+0000
the revenant	I love Leo, and I really liked the movie. I do not put any stock in any opinion an actor has about anything except acting of the movies in which he or she has appeared. They are no more an expert on the theory of global warming than I am on quantum mechanics. I do find the act of flying to a rally on Global warming in your personal gulfstream inconsistant with the passion of one's opinion.Looking forward to Leo's next movie  and thanks for all of the memorable roles from Gilbert Grape to The Aviator.	800926116707956_803460786454489	2016-04-28T00:58:56+0000
the revenant	The water drops on the lens in the river and the snow flakes on the lens takes the whole reality of it away... It's even added as an effect. Feels so real for a minute then that kinda stuff brings back the fact that it's being filmed... Why do they do that?	800926116707956_801187496681818	2016-04-23T04:33:41+0000
the revenant	Leo, you are an entertainer, thats what you were put on this earth to do, so entertain me, don't preach,..... entertain.	800926116707956_800934206707147	2016-04-22T16:59:47+0000
the revenant	There were some really amazing performances by Leo and Tom...but all in all the movie was a real snooze fest...the only exciting scene was the incredibly perfected bear attack, the cinamatography of the scenery was very beautiful admittedly	800926116707956_801358499998051	2016-04-23T12:37:00+0000
the revenant	A great movie, powerful, breathtaking, touching... thank you, Mr. Iñarritu, thanks to all de actors ????.. And climate change IS happening, everyone who doesn't believe it is blind. What we do to this planet will cost us very much (maybe everything). Thank you, Leo for say it out loud ?	800926116707956_909748415825725	2016-11-03T20:18:27+0000
the revenant	Worst movie ever - turned it off after that disgusting scene where he slaughtered a Mother Grizzly for no reason. I HATED this horrid violent piece of cinemagraphic manure	800926116707956_829645673836000	2016-06-20T01:19:52+0000
the revenant	Read the book, "the moral case for fossil fuels". The quality of life has gotten better for so many people despite using greater and greater amounts of natural gas over the years. Climate change is bull mess and to make a huge switch to other forms of energy would demolish an industry that supports families and allows all the worlds communities the ability to function on a daily basis.	800926116707956_800941750039726	2016-04-22T17:25:55+0000

the revenant	I will always contend that Leo's character was The Revenant. I know metaphoric faces and bodies and he was dead long before he actually died with his eyes watering and fighting it; but he was gone.	800461383421096_800557890078112	2016-04-21T21:07:23+0000

the revenant	It was a good movie, but... sorry, Leo... wasn't completely wowed. Sometimes "over hyping" does that to me. Make up miss... your bright teeth made your filth seem not as authentic. Sorry...	799699350163966_802276053239629	2016-04-25T09:29:42+0000

the revenant	I missed talking to my favorite actor by a day; anyway he is the best and should have won an Oscar for The Departed and Gangs of New York. And my son has been mistaken by lovely women who thought He was Leo. He's ten years younger I think than Leo. He's getting his MBA. He would be a great attorney.And he likes all of Leo's movies too; we live in different states and talk a good bit.	799241143543120_800138423453392	2016-04-21T00:29:32+0000
the revenant	It's only a shame that the Soundtrack was not very well used. It had some GREAT moments! But there were some moments that to me brought the movie down some 50%! The main theme was a great piece but almost every time it came on a bad moment. The church scene is an exemple of a miss use of the music. For sure this movie would have been better if some details of the music were different.	799241143543120_801671806633387	2016-04-24T00:50:54+0000

the revenant	A great movie; and I think Leo should have won an Academy Award for both The Departed and Gangs of New York. He was spectacular in this movie; but in many ways otherworldly. I think in the end He was the Revenant.	797803483686886_799270843540150	2016-04-19T02:18:04+0000

don't breathe	#DontBreathe almost had another ending—read ahead to find out what it was.	188889504820245_346448285731032	2016-12-01T04:28:27+0000
don't breathe	Thank goodness Alvarez recognized how depressing that ending would have been. Tension and scares are great but there must be a release and a reason. Why watch a movie where the protagonist suffers and then dies? What's the point of that?
Horror is always at its best when the protagonist endures the horror and survives.	346448285731032_346488569060337	2016-12-01T06:02:03+0000
don't breathe	"The original script, it had a bleaker ending. She ended up in the cellar. In the original script actually there was a trap down in the floor, but we were like, 'Wait a second. We can't do Evil Dead and then a trap door. One in each movie.' We changed it to put a door in the wall. So the trap door she would walk by it and then a hand would come out and grab her leg and drag her in. By the time the police shows up, they never find her because that part of the cellar was more concealed. It's inside of the wall. It's actually under the next door's house - it's a tunnel that connected with the other house that's abandoned next door and that's the cellar he was using."	346448285731032_346845359024658	2016-12-01T16:39:54+0000
don't breathe	It should have ended when the police arrived at the house. Not that "hollywood happy ending but oh no wait its not a happy ending its a stupid set up for a sequel because we want more money ending".	346448285731032_346521835723677	2016-12-01T07:17:18+0000
don't breathe	They should've kept the original ending. The guy goes back for her numerous times throughout the movie and he ends up dead while she gets away with the money? That's bullshit! She wouldn't have made it out if it wasn't for him.	346448285731032_346613772381150	2016-12-01T09:36:28+0000
don't breathe	I don't see why not as it stands the two guys he killed in his home took the blame he told officials everything was in self defense the girl lived and moved away only to later find out the the man they robbed was taken by an ambulance he lived.and so did she.	346448285731032_346470775728783	2016-12-01T05:19:20+0000
don't breathe	She moved to California, she'll blow that money in a month then start stripping and hooking to support her meth habit that she picked up to hide the horrors of what she went through that night. See happy ending :-)	346448285731032_346813885694472	2016-12-01T15:43:30+0000
don't breathe	I like the depressing ending more. I felt like she didn't deserve to escape. If it weren't for her, her friend wouldn't have died trying to save her.	346448285731032_346694872373040	2016-12-01T12:10:21+0000

don't breathe	this movie was not an ordinary horror movie. it has it's own soul. when i started watching it, i started to think that the movie was hyped for nothing and everything was working 'just fine' for me. The true thrill of the movie started when Money was shot out of nowhere. That sudden shock dragged me to excitement I am used to with horror genre. The movie had a few jump scares which wasn't necessarily needed in this one. The story of the movie seemed too simple and doesn't make sense for a 'movie' only if you don't experience the whole thing. Everything about the movie makes a complete sense after watching it whole and when you recall the story back. The ending was quite surprising and perfect for me. A sequel for the movie has been confirmed and will focus on blind man's character.	342236216152239_344844695891391	2016-11-28T15:58:04+0000

don't breathe	Too bad the fat lady behind me talked the entire film. I guess she thought it need commentary. Ruined the movie for me. Hate it when people fulfill stereotypes, like you're the reason those stereotypes exist, stop it!	336815066694354_337402456635615	2016-11-14T17:29:04+0000
don't breathe	Dammit, I can't wait to have this movie on blu-ray. Ridiculously suspenseful and entertaining. Stephan Lang at his best, marvellous :D	336815066694354_337017676674093	2016-11-14T02:29:15+0000
don't breathe	The whole movie was way too predictable. Just running around the house, almost getting away, waiting to see who gets it next. Boring and overdone so many times.	336815066694354_337257326650128	2016-11-14T11:27:53+0000
