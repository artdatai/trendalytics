Just tried to order the $10.00 fried chicken wings bucket at a KFC but they only sell a $10.00 hot wings bucket so I asked them how many wings come in the $10.00 bucket and they told me 12 wings. I thought that was a pretty good price for 12 wings(no fixings come with the $10.00 bucket but we didn't need any sides anyway). When I got home and my husband opened the wings bucket we had 12 half wings. In other words the wing was cut in half and the less meaty side is counted as 1 wing and the drummette part as 1 wing and that made the 12 wings. So really in your 12 wing bucket the customer really gets 6 wings split in half to make 12 pieces. You should make this clear when people buy them!	10153923798056560_10153941783846560	2016-11-11T00:04:37+0000

They gave me 4 strips with a biscuit , also had the potato wedges as a side and the ranch sauce , all in all it is pretty good they weren't false advertising on the label on the box its pretty darn good make sure you have a coke they are a little spicy.	10153920796031560_10153921574246560	2016-11-02T21:37:42+0000
It's not spicy at all. Plus expensive only 5 for $10, chicken was dry. I hate Church's chicken and Popeyes. Please don't make me go. I love the taste of your fried chicken. Get better marketing team.	10153920796031560_10153957631876560	2016-11-16T19:15:29+0000
I bought a Nashville spicy chicken sandwich and it was a normal chicken sandwich with a pinch of the spicy sauce on it. I wasn't too satisfied. I was hoping it was as good as I imagined. I hope they do better next time. KFC in Allentown was a huge mistake to experience.	10153920796031560_10153981434416560	2016-11-27T00:34:09+0000

What in the world is going on with your advertising?  You need to get rid of your advertising agency. They are the absolute worst with having the incredibly dumbest streak of commercials. I've never seen a company as large as yours insist on using an advertising agency that has failed as many times as they have. And then, who is authorizing these ads? It looks like you have a bunch of amateurs that have no idea what they're doing. It reflects very badly on the KFC branding. It's time to throw out the Colonel impersonation idea, it's been screwed up so many times, it's worthless. It's time to start with something completely different. You need a whole new approach (along with a new ad agency).	10153905796186560_10153951344961560	2016-11-14T16:17:12+0000
I was directed to your website because of quite a few friends having seen a distasteful advertisement on television, where "Col. Sanders" is "slapping" the backside of a football player who is holding a tray of food and looking confused. So I went to watch it too. This slapping and hitting behavior is not appropriate in an advertisement for a family-oriented restaurant. I took my elderly father to eat at KFC just two weeks ago. I hope he doesn't see an ad like this on television. And I hope that my grandchildren don't see this ad on television.	10153905796186560_10153957498921560	2016-11-16T17:57:09+0000
I am posting here to KFC's Facebook page because calling the customer service line has gotten me no where. So here goes on 10/06 at location 9848 livernois in Detroit I used my debit card to purchase a meal for my family. That same day someone from the location used my card at a Walmart in Dearborn to the tune of $316, I know it was someone from there as I did not use my card again until, that following Saturday, well I called the KFC location to report the theft and got the most rude night manager. I also called your corporate office on 3 separate occasions and I am still awaiting someone to call me back to just acknowledge my report, to apologize to say something.  This is unacceptable on a multitude of levels for a company that purports to be family oriented to care about the community that and people that it serves. Needless to say you have lost a customer forever, but I guess you don't care because I still haven't gotten a call back about my theft.	10153905796186560_10153950104706560	2016-11-14T05:47:57+0000

I haven't had KFC in years, and I was disappointed today when I stopped by this location and learned they no longer have livers on the menu. (KFC has THE BEST livers--better than my grandma's.)

I ended up going with the three-piece tender meal. I have to say that this was the first time I really enjoyed KFC's mashed potatoes and gravy, and that was because the gravy went from one side of the bowl to the other instead of the usual dollop of gravy I've gotten at other KFC's in the past. Also, I had asked for honey mustard to go with my tenders. When he handed me my bag, I thought the cashier said, "Your honey mustard is in the bag." But apparently I misunderstood and he actually said something about *getting* some honey mustard to put in my bag. He ran outside and caught me in the parking lot to give me my dipping sauce. Now that's going above and beyond! And it was especially nice of him because it appeared that there were only two people working, and there were five dine-in customers and a constant stream at the drive-thru. The two guys who were working were really great as far as being under pressure and providing excellent customer service.	10153904349591560_10153905632256560	2016-10-28T03:13:30+0000

I was pregnant last year and was served undercooked hot wings at a Georgia KFC. My husband called corporate. Nothing. Called again. Still nothing. That was last year. Never received a call back regarding our problem. Luckily I only ate one but my husband had eat about three before we realized. Took food back and management said I'm so glad you came back!! I told them that chicken was not ready. Very disappointed and not coming back especially after being ignored by corporate.	10153894521281560_10153899591121560	2016-10-25T16:23:19+0000

One time I caught a glimpse of the secret spice boxes coming in off the truck. The employee threw glitter in my eyes and when I woke I was in the parking lot with a bucket of chicken in my lap. I think that really happened.	10153891568001560_10153904850836560	2016-10-27T19:24:04+0000

Did the chicken strip go cup always have 2 strips? I thought I remembered it having 3 but I got 2. At most restaurants you can get about 3 chicken strips for $3  so that's $1 per strip. Considering you can get a burger for a dollar at most fast food chains it's weird to think that a strip of chicken costs the same as a burger considering all the differences in the products and more ingredients and labor involved in a burger. Simply put, chicken strips are too expensive.	10153886133091560_10153893111356560	2016-10-23T03:32:54+0000
Love KFC don't get me wrong. But this new "colonel" is a joke. The original colonel Sanders would be rolling over in his grave if he knew how his beloved character had been transformed into the biggest laughing stock in recorded history.	10153886133091560_10153890287906560	2016-10-22T01:43:06+0000

Well I just got home from the greenfield Indiana KFC. Another disappointing visit. Usually when I go it is after 8pm and they are out of half the stuff I order, but today it was only 4 pm, so I thought I'd give it a try. I wanted a three piece extra crispy dark meat box. Well they were out of extra crispy. So I got the original. Then I got home to find I got white meat.  
That's it. That's the last time. I like KFC over Churches.  But for now on. I am a Churches chicken man.	10153886133091560_10153898074931560	2016-10-24T23:36:59+0000
The chicken in the buckets have shrunk in size---$20.00 bucket is half the size the bucket used to be!  And, yes, the pieces are noticeably smaller as well.	10153886133091560_10153891585026560	2016-10-22T15:16:38+0000

Since you won't reply to my message I sent you 

In the past I said this was a 5 star establishment and wrote this about it- absolute best fast food even when it's no where near me I'd still drive to KFC over all other restaurants 

Since then I have been extremely disappointed with their quality of service, quality of food, speed of service, and cleanliness has gone down the crapper  (pun intended) 
Out of my last 5 visits to this location only one that was good was the one that followed me having to make a corporate complaint 

I used to work and love KFC but KFC has a company has really done a horrible job keeping relevant in the fast food industry. Prices have dramatically risen yet they dropped their standards of cleanliness, service, and quality to a level that probably made them lose their biggest fan (Mr. Sanders even randomly defriended me on Facebook; after wishing him a happy birthday) 

What happened KFC? Are you going to continue to let all your establishments turn into the joke of fast food?	10153877148251560_10153883910111560	2016-10-19T21:00:19+0000
I don't know if all of the KFC's have this deal but ours has it with either 12 tenders or 8 pieces of chicken on the bone. So if you want tenders, make sure you specify because we ended up with the chicken on the bone. We took it back and told them they got our order wrong. So they gave us the tenders plus we got to keep the chicken on the bone and they gave us a free dessert.	10153877148251560_10153913105046560	2016-10-30T20:09:42+0000
I used to like KFC but I went recently to one in Georgia and the menu has changed and the quality of food wasn't up to par. The food was cheap ...and the taste and quality explains why.  However I haven't been to one where I live for awhile, so I don't know if the menu varies for different states.  Oh and I do need to add though the people working there were very polite and  very welcoming.	10153877148251560_10153907811721560	2016-10-28T23:47:33+0000
Totally disappointed in your food today!!!!
Ordered the tenders 20$ fill up and I got home with a bucket of original. If I could post a pic on here or at least send y'all this pic of this chicken!!!! One piece was actually burnt black! The rest was greasy!
I'm done with this place! Give me an address I can send this pic too! I cannot believe I paid for this!	10153877148251560_10153892057951560	2016-10-22T18:34:17+0000

Tried it for the first time tonight, my expectations was let down. Did not get any smoky flavor and the sauce I suppose they are supposed to use was all in the bottoms of the container. Had to tear the chicken apart to try and dip it into the little bit there. Looks nothing like what they advertise on TV. Very disappointed!!!!!!!	10153867557141560_10153903465486560	2016-10-27T06:23:29+0000
